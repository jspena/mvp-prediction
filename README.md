# nba-mvp-prediction
Basketball has been one the sports most receptive and committed to the use of data to analyze all facets of the sport. Partnerships with Sportradar and Second Spectrum led to the installation of a multiple camera system for all arenas to capture moment and track statistics.

With this wave of data available, we asked ourselves: can we use data science to predict who will win the regular season MVP award and how many votes they will accumulate before it is announced?

Data files can be found in repository files.

Data exploration was performed using R Studio. Model building and evaluation was conducted in Python through Jupyter Notebook. Additional visualizations on Tableau (using mvp_votes2.csv file).
